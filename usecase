As a learner I would like more practice.

Workbooks I buy only have limited practise, once I do them I need to get a new
workbook. But if I get a new workbook it has a different syllabus

Using strawberry and kimchi, I can practise as much as I want with the same syllabus.

I need MCQ choose the correct grammer, Fill-in-blank (vocab box), Fill-in-blank (no vocab box), Fill-in-blank (correct grammer), reply to question questions.
translation questions

good to have comprehension question
